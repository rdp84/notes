Create a bootable Windows 10 USB
 -------------------------------

    - previously creating bootable usb was pretty simple, formatting USB
      to FAT32.
    - problem now is that Windows 10 ISO contains a install.wim which
      is greater than 4GB. FAT32 doesn't support files > 4GB.
    - to work around this need to create two partitions on USB.
        - one partition will be formatted to FAT32 and hold all files
          required to start boot process
        - second partition will be formatted to NTFS and hold all files
          require to run installation
        - FAT32 partition 2GB in size. NTFS partition at least > 6GB.
        - extract ISO image
        - copy everything except the sources directory to FAT32 partition
        - copy sources directory to NTFS partition
        - on the FAT32 partition create a sources directory. Move
          sources/boot.wim from NTFS partition to sources on FAT32.
    - USB should now boot off FAT32 partition and then hand control to NTFS
      partition to complete installation.
