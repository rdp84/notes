Installing
----------
    - obviously can install Postgres via a package manager but decided to install from source.
    - reasonably simple, the INSTALL file in the source provides useful instructions. The only thing
      ./configure reported was it needed readline, which I installed with dnf install readline
    - things were installed to /usr/local/pgsql. There is a bin directory here which I subsequently
      added to my PATH in .bash_profile to make commands less cumbersome to run.

Starting
--------
    - The install file contains a Getting Started section, which recommends setting up a postgres
      user for the server. Chapter 19 in the main documentation also talks about why to do this.
      Therefore I have done this.
    - I created a database cluster under /usr/local/pgsql/data which is owned by postgres
    - to the start this you need to switch to the postgres account and then start the server

      # switch to postgres
      sudo su - postgres

      # start the server
      /usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl -D /usr/local/pgsql/data start

    - I added PGDATA=/usr/local/pgsql/data and PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/pgsql/bin to the postgres
      bash_profile so this can be shortened to be

      pg_ctl start

Roles
-----
    - Postgres manages database access permissions using the concept of roles. These can be thought
      as a database user or group of database users. The main documentation has a chapter on it, 22,
      which explains things well.
    - When first setup I needed to create a role so I can login to the server and create databases.
      It is recommended to name the role the same as the OS user as by default the client tools
      will try and connect with the name of the role set to the user who is running it.
    - the postgres user is able to create roles so

      sudo su - postgres

      # start the interactive terminal
      psql

      # create a role named bobby and give attribute LOGIN (means they can login) 
      CREATE ROLE bobby LOGIN;

      # add attribute CREATEDB (means they can create databases) to the bobby role
      ALTER ROLE bobby WITH CREATEDB;

      # list current roles, either of:
      \du
      SELECT rolname FROM pg_roles;

    
   - I did play around with role memberships but seemed a bit odd because any member could
     delete a database. But this is what I did

     # have students as our group role
     CREATE ROLE students CREATEDB NOINHERIT;

     # create a couple of roles
     CREATE ROLE bobby LOGIN INHERIT;
     CREATE ROLE david LOGIN INHERIT;

     # Now add roles into the group
     GRANT students TO bobby;
     GRANT students TO david;

     # Can remove from a role from a group
     REVOKE students FROM david

     # now when I login as bobby, the CREATEDB role is never inherited so I first need
     # to SET ROLE to a role having this attribute, in this case students:
     SET ROLE students;
     CREATE DATABASE mydb;

   - to remove a role:
     DROP ROLE david;

   - you might get an error doing this because a database somewhere might be owned by the role.
     Recipe for doing this:

     REASSIGN OWNED BY doomed_role TO successor_role;
     DROP OWNED BY doomed_role;
     # repeat the above commands in each database of the cluster
     DROP ROLE doomed_role;
