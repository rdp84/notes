qcow2 disk
----------
First thing to do is create a qcow2 disk. Can do this with:

    qemu-img create -f qcow2 fedora_7.qcow2 20G

Snapshots in QEMU are images that refer to an original image using redirect-on-write
to avoid changing the original image. If our original image is fedora_7.qcow2
then we need to create a new qcow2 file using the -b flag to indicate a backing file;
any changes to the snapshot file will not be reflected in fedora_7.qcow2:

    qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b fedora_7.qcow2 -F qcow2 snapshot.qcow2

If you run

    qemu-img info snapshot.qcow2

then you will see it is listing its backing file as fedora_7.qcow2

A snapshot image cannot be returned to its original state once it is modified. Instead
you need to delete the file and create another snapshot and start using it.

You will need to boot the virtual machine using this snapshot file. It might be you make
changes in this snapshot file that you would like to be saved into the
original. This is also possible by performing a rebase and then commiting:

    qemu-img rebase -b fedora_7.qcow2 -F qcow2 snapshot.qcow2
    qemu-img commit snapshot.qcow2

Installing OS
-------------
First thing to do is to install an OS. To boot a qemu system from a cdrom can do the following:

    qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm \
    -m 2048 \
    -nic user,model=virtio \
    -hda fedora_7.qcow2 \
    -cdrom ../../ISO/F-7-x86_64-DVD.iso \ # This is the path to the ISO of the OS we want to boot
    -display sdl

This should boot the OS and product a window where you can proceed through the installer, saving
the changes to the attached qcow2 disk.

Booting
-------
Once installed, you'll want to boot back into it:

    qemu-system-x86_64 --enable-kvm \
                   -m 2048 \
                   -hda fedora_7.qcow2 \
                   -netdev user,id=network0,smb=/home/bobby/Computing/Software/SMB/share \
                   -device e1000,netdev=network0,mac=52:54:00:12:34:56 \
                   -display sdl \
                   -vga cirrus

the option
    -vga cirrus

looks like it is only needed for older OS

Mounting SMB Share
------------------
Note - you need to have smb installed on the host. Fedora have a handy guide:
    https://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-32-simple-local-file-sharing-with-samba/


The line in the boot command:
    -netdev user,id=network0,smb=/home/bobby/Computing/Software/SMB/share \

adds a network device and makes a smb share available to the guest on //10.0.2.4/qemu.
This makes sharing of files between the host and guest much easier - essentially it becomes a
shared folder between the two.

The configuration for the smb share will be stored in /tmp/qmeu-smb... directory; this can be useful
if you want to add some different options to the smb share for when it is mounted in the guest.
Fedora 7 has version 1.0 of the smb client so you need to tell the smb server to accept connections
from this version; servers now don't allow it by default for security reasons. Can do this by adding
the following to the config file under the [global] section:

    min protocol = NT1

On the guest can then mount the share (as root) with something like:

    mount -t cifs //10.0.2.4/qemu share/ -o user=bobby,vers=1.0 --verbose
