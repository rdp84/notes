RPM & DNF
---------
    - I fancided having a go at creating my own rpm and using DNF since I use
      it extensively and don't really know what is happening
    - the following is a good guide on packaging:
      https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/Packaging_Tutorial_GNU_Hello/
    - I followed the above but then an into a problem when I ran the linting stage,
      it reported the following to me:
      hello.src: W: strange-permission hello.spec 600

    - On running rpmquery --query --list --dump hello-2.10-1.fc37.src.rpm
      you see:
      hello.spec 1374 1681195876 8f31b5c01a92645d4a2fca268e6950e106e02e8fd20b6965b321f02957a09012 0100600 bobby bobby 0 0 0 X

      so you can see the spec file does indeed have strange permissions. Really it should be 0644

    - The guide linked to above uses fedpkg and mockbuild which didn't give many clues as to stop
      it from happening
    - I looked into using rpmbuild instead, The following explains it well:
      https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/create-rpm-package         

      # Build the source RPM
      rpmbuild -bs SPECS/hello.spec

      # Build the binary RPM
      rpmbuild -bb SPECS/hello.spec

      # List files in a RPM
      rpmquery --list --package RPMS/x86_64/hello-2.10-1.fc37.x86_64.rpm

      # Get further details
      rpmquery --list --package --dump RPMS/x86_64/hello-2.10-1.fc37.x86_64.rpm

      # List package's runtime dependencies
      rpm --query --package --requires RPMS/x86_64/hello-2.10-1.fc37.x86_64.rpm

      # To check which packages in Fedora repositories provide these dependencies
      dnf -C repoquery --whatprovides 'libc.so.6()(64bit)'

      # To check what capailities a package provides
      rpm --query --package --provides RPMS/x86_64/hello-2.10-1.fc37.x86_64.rpm

      # Installing
      sudo dnf -C -y install ./RPMS/x86_64/hello-2.10-1.fc37.x86_64.rpm

      # View information once installed
      dnf --info --installed hello

      # Remove
      sudo dnf remove hello
