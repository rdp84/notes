Jails
-----

To get a rootfs, probably easiest to export a Docker container:

    > docker pull fedora
    > docker run --rm -it fedora /bin/bash

    # In another terminal

    > docker export <container_id> -o fedora.tar.gz
    > tar -C fedora_rootfs -xvf fedora.tar.gz

Now have a full rootfs to use with chroot

    > sudo chroot fedora_rootfs/ /bin/bash

Jails can be useful for testing out changes. As an example use GNU Coreutils

    # Download a version from https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/
    > mkdir coreutils
    > tar -C coreutils -xvf <coreutils.xx.yy.tar.gz>
    > cd coreutils

    # In src/ directory make a simple change to a util such as rm, e.g.,
    # by default set it to always ask if you wish to remove a file

    > ./configure --prefix=<full path to rootfs>
    > make
    > sudo make install

    # Above should install the modified version into the rootfs.
    # Now when you run the jail should see the change

    > sudo chroot fedora_rootfs/ /bin/bash
    > touch /home/foo.txt
    > rm /home/foo.txt    # This should prompt for confirmation of removal

It is possible to setup your own rootfs to use as a jail, although takes a bit of time.
