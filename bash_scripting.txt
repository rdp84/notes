Bash scripting
--------------

Shebang
-------

Best practice to declare on first line of script which interpreter to use. Generally I use bash so we provide the
path to the bash binary, preceded by the shebang character
sequence (#!) like so:

    #!/bin/bash

Variables
---------

To declare a variable simply provide an identifier
followed by the equals character:

    my_variable=3
    another_variable="a string"

To then refer back to that variable, use the identifier
prefixed with the dollar character:

    echo "my_variable=$my_variable"
    echo "another_variable=$another_variable"

Comments
--------

Use the hash character to add a comment:

    # It is always worth commenting things for later use

Exit Status
-----------

You can save the output of a command into a variable with
something like:

    OUTPUT=$(ls -l /home)
    echo "OUTPUT=$OUTPUT"

The exit status of the last run command is stored in the
variable '$?'. Remember that every command returns an
exit status so the value of this variable will be
overriden by the exit status of future commands. Therefore
if you are interested in the exit status of a particular
command then it is best to save it in another variable:

    # ls exits with 2 since non-existent dir
    ls -l /hOme/
    # save the exit status of the previous ls-command
    ls_exit_status=$?
    # prints 0 since previous assignment was successful
    echo "\$?=$?"
    # prints 2 since that is what ls exited with
    echo "ls_exit_status=$ls_exit_status"

Command Separator
-----------------

The semi-colon can be used as a command separator - it is
basically like pressing the ENTER key to execute a
command:

    # This will first execute ls -a followed by ls -l
    # It has all been written on the one line though
    ls -a; ls -l

test command
------------

The command separator becomes useful when we want to use the test
command and write conditionals:

    grep -irs '^bob\+y' /etc
    GREP_EXIT_STATUS=$?

    if [ $GREP_EXIT_STATUS -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "grep returned zero"
    elif [ $GREP_EXIT_STATUS -eq 1 ]; then
         echo "grep returned one"
    elif [ $GREP_EXIT_STATUS -eq 2 ]; then
         echo "grep returned two"
    else
        echo "grep returned: $GREP_EXIT_STATUS"
    fi

Important things to remember from above:

    [ EXPRESSION ] is an alternative to test EXPRESSION

    The whitespace after `[` and before `]` is important -
    you get a syntax error if it is not present

    `fi` is also important, missing that produces a
    syntax error.

    Making use of `;` means we can write statements on
    the one line

Extended test command
---------------------

The [[ ]] construct is the more versatile Bash version of
[ ]. It is known as the extended test command and using
it can prevent many logic errors in scripts. It is
possbile to use &&, ||, < and > operators, which would
give an error if used in the [ ] construct.

    grep -irs '^bob\+y' /etc
    GREP_EXIT_STATUS=$?

    ls -a
    LS_EXIT_STATUS=$?

    if [[ $GREP_EXIT_STATUS -eq 0 && \
          $LS_EXIT_STATUS -eq 0 ]]; then
        echo "grep and ls returned zero"
    elif [[ $GREP_EXIT_STATUS -eq 1 && \
            $LS_EXIT_STATUS -eq 0 ]]; then
        echo "grep returned one, ls returned zero"
    elif [[ $GREP_EXIT_STATUS -eq 2 && \
            $LS_EXIT_STATUS -eq 0 ]]; then
         echo "grep returned two, ls returned zero"
    else
        echo "grep returned: $GREP_EXIT_STATUS"
    fi

for loop
--------

Basic syntax of a for loop is

      for <variable name> in <a list of items>;do <some command> $<variable name>;done;

In the following example take the output of the git branch command as our list of items:

   for branch in $(git branch); do if [ $branch = 'master' ]; then echo "found master"; else echo "found something else"; fi; done


Functions
---------

Basic syntax of a function is

    function myFunc() {
        echo "hello, world"
        return 55
    }

Can use the command separator to shorten this to be

    function myFunc() { echo "hello, world"; return 55; }

To pass arguments to a function put them straight after the name, separated by a space.
The passed parameters are then $1, $2, $3 ... $n
The $# variable holds the number of arguments
The $* and $@ variables hold all positional parameters passed to the function.
    "$*" expands to "$1 $2 $n"
    "$@" expands to "$1" "$2" "$n"

    function greeting() { echo "a message from greeting"; echo "your name is $1"; }
    |> greeting bobby
