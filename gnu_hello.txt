GNU Hello
---------
The GNU Hello program produces a familiar, friendly greeting. It is another implementation
of the classic program that prints “Hello, world!” when you run it. However it is written
in C and is a useful; learning resource for building software.

Download
--------
    - stable sources can be found at
      https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/
    - it is better to use a mirror though since you can find one which is geographically
      closer. For UK, have the University of Kent mirror service:
      https://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/
    - could download via a browser but I fancied using ftp so:

      # connect to ftp mirror
      ftp mirrorservice.org

      # login anonymously with username `anonymous`. Don't need a password
      # then use ls, cd to look around. For help, use `?` or for a specifc command
      # `? get`
      cd /sites/ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello
      get hello-2.12.1.tar.gz ~/Computing/Software/Hello/GNU/hello-2.12.1.tar.gz

    - remember the firewall in Fedora so need to add the service
      sudo firewall-cmd --zone=FedoraWorkstation --add-service=ftp

    - extract with `tar -xvf hello-2.12.1.tar.gz`

Installation
------------
    - INSTALL file gives details on how to do the install but roughly goes:

      # configure the package for the system (will check we have everything it needs)
      ./configure

      # compile
      make

      # install. By default will install to /usr/local/bin/, /usr/local/share/man etc which
      # is owned by root so need elevated privileges
      sudo make install

      # remove program binaries and object files from source code directory
      make clean
    
      # remove installed files, will need elevated privileges
      sudo make uninstall

    - In Fedora most things go under /usr/bin, /usr/share/man etc. To do this can set
      --prefix=PREFIX in configure, so:
      ./configure --prefix=/usr/

Running
-------
    - should be able to just do
      hello
    - to see the manual
      man hello
